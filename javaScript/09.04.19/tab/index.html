                <h1>Primary</h1>
                <p>A primary school (or elementary school in American English and often in Canadian English) is a school in which children
                receive primary or elementary education from the age of about five to eleven, coming after preschool, infant school and
                before secondary school. (In some countries there is an intermediate stage of middle school between primary and
                secondary education.)</p>
                <p>In most parts of the world, primary education is the first stage of compulsory education, and is normally available
                without charge, but may be offered in a fee-paying independent school. The term grade school is sometimes used in the
                US, although this term may refer to both primary education and secondary education.</p>

            <div class="item">
                <h1>High School</h1>
                <p>A secondary school is both an organization that provides secondary education and the building where this takes place.
                Some secondary schools can provide both lower secondary education and upper secondary education (levels 2 and 3 of the
                ISCED scale), but these can also be provided in separate schools, as in the American middle and high school system.</p><p>
                
                Secondary schools typically follow on from primary schools and lead into vocational and tertiary education. Attendance
                is compulsory in most countries for students between the ages of 11 and 16. The organisations, buildings, and
                terminology are more or less unique in each country.</p>

                <h1>College</h1>
                <p>A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a
                    degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, an institution
                    offering
                    vocational education or a secondary school.</p>
                <p>
                
                    In the United States, "college" may refer to a constituent part of a university or to a degree-awarding tertiary
                    educational institution, but generally "college" and "university" are used interchangeably,[1] whereas in the United
                    Kingdom, Oceania, South Asia, Southern Africa and Canada, "college" may refer to a secondary or high school, a
                    college
                    of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher education provider that does
                    not
                    have university status (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university (See
                    this
                    comparison of British and American English educational terminology for further information).</p>

            <div class="item">
            <h1>University</h1>
            <p>A university (Latin: universitas, 'a whole') is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which
            awards academic degrees in various academic disciplines. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and
            postgraduate education.</p>
            <p>The word university is derived from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium, which roughly means "community of
            teachers and scholars".[1] While antecedents had existed in Asia and Africa,[2] the modern university system has roots
            in the European medieval university, which was created in Italy and evolved from Catholic Cathedral schools for the
            clergy during the High Middle Ages.</p>
